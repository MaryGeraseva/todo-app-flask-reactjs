1. Error Analysis
The error message is:
Apply
This error occurs when the Flask app tries to create a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication, but no secret key is set in the app’s configuration.
2. Root Cause
The flask_jwt_extended library requires either JWT_SECRET_KEY or Flask’s SECRET_KEY to be set in the app’s config.
If neither is set, the library cannot securely sign tokens, so it raises a RuntimeError.
3. Where the Error Occurs
The error is triggered in the login flow, specifically when calling create_access_token in AuthController.sign_in.
The stack trace shows the error propagates from the JWT library up to your Flask app.
4. How the App Was Configured
In your backend/flaskr/__init__.py (the Flask app factory), the app loads configuration from DevelopmentConfig or a test config.
However, if neither config sets SECRET_KEY (or JWT_SECRET_KEY), the app will not have a secret key for JWT.
5. The Fix
The fix is to ensure that SECRET_KEY is always set in the Flask app’s configuration.
In the app factory, after loading the config, we check if SECRET_KEY is set:
Apply
This guarantees that a secret key is present, preventing the runtime error.
6. Why This Fix Works
With SECRET_KEY set, flask_jwt_extended can securely sign and verify JWTs.
The login flow and any other JWT-protected endpoints will now work as intended.
7. Best Practice
In production, you should set a strong, unpredictable secret key via environment variables or a secure config file, not hardcoded as shown in the patch.
Summary:
The error was caused by a missing SECRET_KEY in the Flask app config, which is required for JWT authentication. The fix is to ensure SECRET_KEY is always set, either from config or by providing a default, so JWT creation works and the app runs without error.
apply changes

The patch has been applied: your Flask app factory now ensures that SECRET_KEY is always set, which will resolve the JWT creation error. The only remaining linter error is due to the Flask import not being resolved, which is an environment issue and not related to the logic or patch.
