##OBJECTIVE:  
Analyze and refactor the file `backend\flaskr\controllers\task_controller.py` to improve code quality, naming, structure, and performance. Apply modern Python best practices and conventions.

##ROLE  
Act as a **Senior Python Developer Agent** and perform static code review and targeted refactoring of the selected file.

##INST.RUCTIONS:  
From the code perspective, use these guidelines:  
- Use an AI Agent to scan the file for code smells, anti-patterns, and poor design  
- Identify flaws such as:  
  - Poor function/class naming  
  - Unclear responsibilities or large methods  
  - Lack of input validation or error handling  
  - Redundant logic or performance issues  
- Refactor based on AI Agentâ€™s insight  
- Keep behavior consistent, but improve clarity, maintainability, and efficiency  
- Use modern Python best practices (e.g., type hints, data classes if appropriate, PEP8)  
- Result should be a cleaner, modular, and well-structured version of the original file

##OUTPUT:  
Output the full **refactored version** of `task_controller.py`  
Only include the updated code in a code block.  
No explanations or diffs, just the final, improved source file.
