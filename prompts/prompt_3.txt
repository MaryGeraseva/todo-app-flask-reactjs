##OBJECTIVE:  
Map all files, classes, and functions used in the core **login** feature. Identify relevant files involved in the complete user login flow using GenAI assistance. The output should be structured and comprehensive enough to support debugging, refactoring, or documentation.

##ROLE  
Act as a **Skilled Software Architect** and generate a **comprehensive map of the login flow**, identifying related files, classes, and functions using project-wide code analysis.

##INST.RUCTIONS:  
From the code perspective, use these guidelines:  
- Search across the project for all relevant files and components connected to the login flow  
- Include UI components, API handlers, services, utilities, and auth modules  
- Group results by layer: e.g., Frontend (components, hooks), Backend (routes, controllers, services), Shared/Utils  
- For each file, include:  
  - File path  
  - Key functions or classes used  
  - Brief purpose of the file (1 sentence)  
- Present data in a clear and hierarchical bullet format  
- Only include items directly related to login (ignore unrelated auth actions like registration or password reset)

##OUTPUT:  
Save the results in a file named `solution_3.md`.  
Output must include:
- File paths
- Key classes/functions
- Descriptions (brief)
