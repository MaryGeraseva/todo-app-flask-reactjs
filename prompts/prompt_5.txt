##OBJECTIVE:  
Propose a comprehensive **test strategy and matching tech stack** for the `UserController` located at `\backend\flaskr\controllers\user_controller.py`.

##ROLE  
Act as a **Senior QA and AQA Architect** and generate a structured test strategy including types of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) and recommended tools for each layer.

##INST.RUCTIONS:  
From the code perspective, use these guidelines:  
- Identify appropriate test layers: Unit, Integration, End-to-End (E2E)  
- For each test type, describe:
  - What should be tested
  - Why it's important
  - Recommended tools/libraries (Python ecosystem)
- Address mocking, data setup, and test isolation techniques  
- Suggest folder/file structure for organizing the tests  
- Mention CI/CD considerations for automation if applicable  
- Output must be clearly organized and ready for documentation use

##OUTPUT:  
Save the results to `solutions/solution_5.md`  
Output should be formatted with section headers like:
- Test Strategy Overview  
- Unit Tests  
- Integration Tests  
- End-to-End (E2E) Tests  
- Suggested Tech Stack  
- Test Organization Structure  
- CI/CD & Automation Notes
