##OBJECTIVE:  
Create a **runnable test file skeleton** for the class `UserController` located at `\backend\flaskr\controllers\user_controller.py`. The goal is to scaffold a test file with proper structure, imports, and placeholders for test methods.

##ROLE  
Act as a **Senior Python Test Engineer** and generate a boilerplate **pytest-style test file** with stub functions and comments for coverage expansion.

##INST.RUCTIONS:  
From the code perspective, use these guidelines:  
- Use `pytest` as the test framework  
- Import the `UserController` class and any required dependencies  
- Include a `TestUserController` class  
- Define placeholder test methods for key functions in `UserController` (e.g., `test_get_user`, `test_create_user`, etc.)  
- Use docstrings or inline comments to explain what each test should cover  
- Include a basic `setup_method` or fixture example if needed  
- Ensure the file is syntactically correct and runnable even with placeholder test bodies

##OUTPUT:  
Output the complete test skeleton in a single Python code block.  
The test file must be named according to convention, e.g., `solution_4.py`, and placed under `solutions/` directory.
